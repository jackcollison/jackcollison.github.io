Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://econ.wisc.edu/).My research interests lie broadly in the field of industrial organization and econometrics. I have worked on topics related to digital platforms, transportation, health economics, and augmenting traditional methods with machine learning.

I graduated with an M.S. in Statistics from [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu) where I studied statistics. I also earned a B.A. in Economics from Stanford with [honors](https://economics.stanford.edu/impact-online-food-delivery-services-restaurant-sales).

If you have any questions or want to connect, feel free to [reach out](mailto:jcollison@wisc.edu) to me.
